## Known Limitations

### Quiet Hours

- Only one time range per settings (not multiple ranges)
- Uses system time (no automatic timezone adjustments)
- Hours only (can't set 22:30, just 22)
- Respects local system time, not UTC

### General

- Cannot interact with multi-step Claude features
- Extended thinking is auto-disabled
- Requires Claude.ai to be accessible
- Works only on chromium-based browsers

---

## Troubleshooting

### Quiet Hours not working?

1. **Checkbox is checked**: ✅ Must be enabled
2. **Settings saved**: Click "Save & Enable"
3. **Extension reloaded**: Refresh in chrome://extensions
4. **Correct format**: Use 0-23 (24-hour format)
